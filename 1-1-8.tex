Overview:
- Representation of images and objects and events using algorithms for
 - Recognizing
 - Detecting
 - Segmenting

Image processing:
 - Produces image
 - More realted to Graphics

Computer vision:
 - Produces representation
 - More related to Machine learning

- Computer vision
 - A lot of information is lost in capturing images
  - Spacial relationships are lost
 - Very iterative
 - No general Theory
 - Trial and error

Matrix or Tensor:
 - F(x,y)
 - x, y, f(x,y) are discrete and finite
 - Image size represented: max_x X max_y ($a \times b$)
 - pixel intensity function: $f(x,y) \in [0,255]$

- Color has very little relevance on classification
- red 65\% 700 nm
- green: 33\% 546.1nm
- blue: 2\% 435.8 nm

Cartisian color system
- Imagine RGB color cube

Polar coordinate color system:
- Circle HSV

Terminalogy:
- Feature: part of the image
- Feature descriptor: vector that describes a feature

informative vs non informative features:
- some features give us a lot more information

We mostly care about the most descriminative feature of an object

* a good feature descriptor describes the most descriminative feature of the object or event

Edge:
 - Connected pixels with high gradient value

Region:
 - Connected set of similar pixels
