Image Filtering and Harris Corners:
- We try to reduce complexity first:
 - find features
  - Keypoints (SIFT, HOG)
  - Edge contures, curves, shapes, boundries
  - Regions
  - Tectures


Filtering:
- Corelation or convolution or filtering:
- filter can be smaller or bigger than the image
- elementwise product
\[g(x,y) \sum^a_{i=-a} \sum^b_{j=-b} w(i,j)f(x+i, y+j)\]

example:
- Average filter:
 - spacial averageing
 - weighted averaging

image gradient:
 - Deprecated: Detect edges
 \[I_x(x,y) = I(x+1, y) - I(x,y)\]

Laplacian:
 - Apply gradient filter twice
 - second gradient on top of first one

Harris corners:
- Locality: robust tp noise
- Saliency: rich visual cue
- Stable under transforms
- Distinctiveness: 
- Efficiency: easy to compute

Method of corner detection:
- 3 states:
 - homogenous region
  - no change in any direction
 - edge
  - nno change along edges
 - corner
  - changes in all directions

Equation:
\[M(x,y) = w(x,y) \times (\grad f(x,y))^2\]
- $M(x,y)$ : pixel variation 2x2
- $ w(x,y)$: Smoothing filter
- $\grad f(x,y))^2$ squared image gradient
- we will find a ratio
 - frac{\lambda_1 \lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} = frac{det(M)}{trace(M)}
